<!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" >It is clear that the neuroinformatics landscape is growing in the availability of whole-brain statistical maps
for meta-analysis, as well as terminologies to describe them, but lacking in publicly available software with
robust methods to perform meta-analysis across disparate resources. Toward the goal of developing
convergent methods for image comparison, I present my dissertation, which will review in detail the
following specific aims:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Aim 1: to define optimized, spatial pairwise image comparison strategies</li></ul>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Aim 2: to assess semantic image comparison against traditional approaches</li></ul>
<!--l. 577--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 2 (Aim 1: Spatial Image Comparison) I will show that there are optimal methods for spatial
comparison of of whole-brain statistical maps. I identify pairwise comparison methods that are in line with
the goals of the researcher - optimal retrieval of maps from a particular experimental paradigm. This
simple method of deriving a similarity score from a thresholded image, and only comparing
spatial locations defined in both maps, results in 98.4% classification accuracy, and is robust
across data derived from different individuals and a wide array of experimental paradigms. This
work sets up a best practice for individual neuroimaging researchers to perform meta-analysis,
calculate similarity of brain maps for purposes of determining replication, and an informed
basis for developers of tools that assess the replication of neuroimaging results based on spatial
information.
<!--l. 591--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 3 (Aim 2: Semantic Image Comparison) I present work to suggest that semantic information
about statistical brain maps can be useful in a classification framework. I review automated and openly
available methods for semantic classification of statistical brain maps, and demonstrate that such a
comparison is comparable to the more commonly done calculation of spatial similarity. I demonstrate that
whole brain statistical maps can be predicted from cognitive concepts, and cognitive concepts can be
derived from statistical brain maps.
<!--l. 598--><p class="indent" >   In Appendix A (Standardizing Behavioral Experimentation) I discuss an applied extension
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
of my work: an open source, infrastructure to collaboratively develop and deploy behavioral
experiments. Standardization on the level of the experimental paradigms themselves is essential to
remove variance in the task portion of the study of behavior. I have created standard data
structures, virtual machines, and web-based software to assist researchers with the definition and
generation of experimental paradigms. This work will further bring reproducibility to behavioral
science.
<!--l. 606--><p class="indent" >   In Appendix B (Visualization Best Practices for Complex Brain Connectivity Data) and
Appendix C (Best Practices for Reproducible Research) I discuss best practices and technology for
reproducible science. To supplement these points, I provide examples of web-based tools that I have
developed to assist with analysis, retrieval, and visualization. I provide these tools as publicly
available resources for sharing, viewing, and performing meta analysis for whole-brain statistical
maps.
<!--l. 613--><p class="indent" >   This work, which can be called &#8220;Convergent Methods for Spatial and Semantic Image Comparison&#8221; will
be the first of its type to span medical imaging expertise, machine learning, and data visualization to bring
standardization to the image comparison tasks that are essential to link cognitive processes to mental
illness. These aims will be presented in detail in the following chapters to constitute the core of this
dissertation.
