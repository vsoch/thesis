<!--l. 621--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter, I present work [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] to suggest that there are optimal methods for spatial comparison of of
whole-brain statistical maps (Specific Aim #1, Section 1.5). I begin with an introduction to spatial
comparison of whole-brain maps in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research (fMRI) to
convince of the importance for identifying intelligent methods for image comparison for meta-analysis and
reproducibility that are in line with the goals of the research.

<!--l. 630--><p class="noindent" >The computation of similarity between images is an increasingly important component of neuroimaging
analyses. In the context of reproducibility, statistical brain maps must be compared to evaluate if a new
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
result has successfully replicated a previous one. For approaches that involve clustering, a distance or
similarity matrix is commonly defined that makes a comparison between all pairwise maps. For
meta-analytic decoding [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], one must be able to identify similarity between the target image and each
image in the relevant database.
<!--l. 639--><p class="indent" >   One challenge in computation of image similarity is the presence of empty (zero-valued) voxels due to
thresholding. The clearest example comes from coordinate-based meta-analysis, where voxels outside of
regions with activation peaks will have a zero value. However, the problem arises in other domains as well,
such as the NeuroVault database [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. The maps in NeuroVault represent a broad range of
statistical tests, and while a warning is issued when a user uploads a thresholded map, there is no
hard restriction. At the time of writing this thesis, for the 2581 publicly available group-level
maps in the NeuroVault database, 657 (~25.5%) have fewer than 25% of non-empty voxels
observed within an MNI template brain mask, meaning they are thresholded images. Part
of the work behind this dissertation was driven by the need for NeuroVault to allow for the
ability to compare a single result map to all others in the database. This reality presented with
the challenge of performing image comparison in the presence of thresholding choices that
may introduce many &#8220;faux zeros,&#8221; or even eliminate negative values completely. The impact
of these empty voxels on image comparison was not understood, giving the impetus for this
work.
